# Description

Create Picky Waterwheels modifies Create's Waterwheels default behavior. It makes it so they work similarly to Hose Pulleys, where the wheels require to be in contact with a large body of water, but in addition to that, they also require to be inside a River Biome to function. Otherwise, there is no power generation. This change is applied to both small and large waterwheels.

The mod also modifies Create's Windmill default behavior. It makes it so they check the surrounding area to see if there is enough open space for "air to circulate." It also checks the biome of placement, and by default only allows the Windmills to work inside the Overworld.

This mod adds no new blocks.

For the warning tooltips, like shown below for that windmill, use Create's Google.

Configuration is available for the threshold like for the Hose Pulley in Create. For the biome requirements, it can be tweaked via a biome tag.

This project was designed to work in tandem with Crete Low-Heated [plus, the intent is to pair it with capacity nerfed windmills and waterwheels].
